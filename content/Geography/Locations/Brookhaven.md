> ![[../../Brookhaven Location.png|Brookhaven Location]]


A small little village in the southeast [[../Regions/Hisa|hisa region]] with a tiny Fallen Sun that somehow manages to keep on trucking. This town has a population of fewer than a hundred people. Despite how small it is, it is just close enough to the usual travel routes that there's a large inn. 

Travellers usually end up swept into the town due to a storm or otherwise getting lost, and the folk here are warm and welcoming to their guests. Most of the villagers are rabbitfolk, though there are various other races that found themselves settled down.

### People

**Darielle** - a loxodon (mammothtaur) man who runs the local tavern & inn, called the Tavern-plus-Inn. At least 60 years old, despite being good at his job, not a fan of all the small talk and nonsense that comes as part of running a tavern. He employs Corrick at the inn. Generally seems as though he's one bad day away from heart failure, but he isn't a mean or cruel man. <br>
**Maiwen** - a not-local goblin. Technically a traveler, but she hasn't exactly continued to travel. She mostly seems to hang around the tavern, variously drunk. Bites if provoked, but otherwise having a good time. <br>
