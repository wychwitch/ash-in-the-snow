Common folk
    - There are many folk, [[../Races/Races Landing|the full list can be found here]] , but the most common are Plainsfolk, Rabbitfolk, Dwarves, Elves, & Dragonborn. 
        - Also, *human* is a catch-all term for any "humanoid" race. So calling a Goblin a Human is correct. These are dungeon meshi rules!
- Arctic Foxes
    - Intelligent foxes that can perfectly mimic human voices. While smart, they are still animals and only really use their mimicry to fool humans in order to steal their food. Some folk keep them as pets.
- Visonary Dragons
    - Incredibly ancient dragons that are immune to the cold of Havenloft. They have no eyes. Not even a socket within which eyes once grew in some evolutionary ancestor. The top half of their faces, aside from their nostrils, is smooth and hard like a perfect wedge of marble. 
    - Like trees, they never stop growing as they age. Unlike trees, there has never been a record of them dying of old age.
    - They are incredibly wise and regal, and most will even give advice to those who take the time to visit their domains.  Some even say that they dream of the future.
- The Frozen Undead
    - If a dead body is left buried under snow for an entire moon cycle, they will rise again to become the frozen undead. [[../Lore/Mysteries|No one knows why this may be.]] However, because of this funeral rites have become complex and almost always involve the cremation of the dead.
    - They can lay under the snow for years before rising.
