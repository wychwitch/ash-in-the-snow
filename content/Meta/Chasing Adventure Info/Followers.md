## Followers  
## Creating a Follower  
Name and describe your follower, working with the GM and other  
players to detail it. Then choose one or two Qualities that they have,  
and the GM will tell you an equal number of Costs.  
Some Followers gained through certain Advanced Moves or other  
unusual circumstances may have special or unique Qualities - these do  
not increase the Costs.   
The GM will then create the Follower like any other NPC, following  
the NPCs section of the Game Master chapter on Page 95, and giving  
them a Want, Methods, Conditions, and Armor.  
Finally, the GM will give them a few Descriptors, similar to Item Tags,  
fitting who or what they are.  
Example Qualities  
- **Charming**: They are desirable or have a way with words. When they help you Compel someone who Favors you, you can gain the bonus from their Favor without using it up.  
- **Cunning**: Clever and observant. When they help you Examine,  treat a 7-9 as a 10+.  
- **Educated**: They’re knowedgeable about a particular subject.  When they help you Ponder it, they’ll also give you an additional  interesting (but not necessarily useful) piece of information.  
- **Healer**: When they tend to wounds with Supplies or Medicine, they can treat two patients with 1 use.  
- **Meek**: They accept their lowly lot. They will agree to do degrading and unreasonable tasks without the need to Command them.  
- **Organized**: They follow plans well and work well in a group. Once they agree to a plan, you don’t need to Command them as long as the plan doesn’t go awry.  
- **Warrior**: They count as +1 Armor when they help you fight, and you don’t have to Command them to fight unless the opposition is terrifying or overwhelming.  
### Example Costs  
- **Assistance**: They inevitably need your help at the most  
inopportune moments.  
- **Brutality**: They have an instinct or outright desire for savage, unnecessary violence.  
- **Ego**: They want frequent and regular credit for heroics, regardless of whether or not they truly contributed.  
- **Independence**: They may follow you for convenience or mutual gain, but they are not truly loyal to you.  
- **Principles**: They have a code, belief or boundary that they expect you to adhere to.  
- **Riches**: They demand regular coins, gems or other valuables.  
- **Safety**: They expect you to protect them from any danger, or ideally for there to be no danger at all.  
- **Unstable**: They can sometimes be a danger to you, and you have to be prepared to put up with that.  
### Example Descriptors  
- **Athletic**: Good at running, climbing, jumping, and physical  maneuvering.  
- **Cautious**: Careful and methodical; avoids acting rashly.  
- **Devious**: Deceitful, treacherous, thieving.  
- **Stealthy**: Avoids detection; often gets the drop on foes.  
- **Beautiful**: Draws admiration and attention; makes an impression.  
- **Terrifying**: Their presence and appearance invoke fear.  
- **Group**: A team, gang, or mob, with all the strengths and drawbacks of greater numbers.  
- **Ferocious**: Merciless, violent, and aggressive.  
- **(In)Famous**: They’re well-known, for good or for ill.  
- **Stubborn**: Tough, hard-working, and willing to put up with discomfort.  
- **Self-Sufficient**: Can easily navigate and live off the land.  
- **Faithful**: Dedicated to a religion, belief, or cause.
