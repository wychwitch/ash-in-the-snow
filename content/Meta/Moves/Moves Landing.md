## Adventure Moves  
### Defy  
<span class="move-trigger">When you act despite an imminent threat or obstacle,</span> tell us how you  
do it. Then roll...  
- **+STR** if you endure or power through it.  
- **+DEX** if you act with speed or finesse.  
- **+INT** if you employ quick or out-of-the-box thinking.  
- **+WIS** if you rely on mental fortitude or sharp senses.  
- **+CHA** if you use charm, intrigue, or social grace.  
  
On a **10+** the threat doesn’t come to bear.  
On a **7-9** it only abates if you make a costly sacrifice or ugly choice,  
the GM will tell you what.  
  
### Engage  
<span class="move-trigger">When you openly fight an enemy up close,</span> roll **+STR**.  
On a **7-9** you and your enemy trade blows, usually inflicting a  
condition on each other.  
On a **10+** you trade blows, but **choose one:**  
- Avoid or withstand their attack  
- Inflict an extra condition  
- Take something from them  
  
### Let Fly  
<span class="move-trigger">When you attack a clear target from afar,</span> roll **+DEX.**  
On a **10+** your clean hit inflicts a condition.  
On a **7-9** you inflict a condition but are either put in a dangerous  
position or gain Disadvantage Forward, your choice.  
Ponder  
<span class="move-trigger">When you consider what you know about a subject,</span> ask the GM one  
question about it, say how you might know the answer, and roll **+INT.**  
On a **10+** the GM will tell you the detailed, useful truth.  
On a **7-9** they will tell you a vague, twisted, or incomplete truth.  
You and your allies have Advantage when first acting on this  
information.  
Here are some example questions:  
- Where is located?  
- What could have caused ?  
- What might be the best way to ?  
- What have I heard or read about this person/creature?  
  
### Examine  
<span class="move-trigger">When you closely investigate a charged situation,</span> ask the GM one  
question about it and roll **+WIS**.  
On a **10+** the GM answers your question and related followup  
questions truthfully.  
On a **7-9** the GM answers your question truthfully.  
You and your allies roll with Advantage when first acting on this  
information.  
Here are some example questions:  
- Who/what else is hidden?  
- How can I gain the upper hand?  
- What would happen here if I did ?  
- Who is really in control here?  
  
### Scrutinize  
<span class="move-trigger">When you have an intimate or prying conversation with someone,</span>  
roll **+WIS**.  
On a **10+** gain 2 Insight. On a **7-9** gain 1 Insight.  
Gain **+1** Insight if they Favor you, even on a **6-**.  
During this conversation you can spend Insight 1-for-1 to ask their  
player (including the GM) any question about this person’s thoughts,  
feelings or motivations and they must answer truthfully.  
Here are some example questions:  
- How might I get you to ?  
- How do you feel about ?  
- How can I gain your Favor?  
- What is your goal?  
  
### Compel  
<span class="move-trigger">When you use favor,</span> payment, promises, or threats to get someone  
to do something, say what you want them to do (or not to do) and  
roll **+CHA**. If they Favor you, you may use up their Favor to gain  
Advantage on the roll.  
For NPCs, on a **10+** they’ll do what you want. On a **7-9** they’ll only do  
it if you do something for them in return or Favor them afterwards,  
the GM will say which.  
For PCs, on a **10+** both below occur, on a **7-9** choose one below  
to occur, and on a **6-** they instead can immediately ask you two  
questions as if they Scrutinized you.  
- If they do it, you will Favor them.  
- If they don’t do it, they have Disadvantage Forward and you no  
longer Favor them.  
  
### Cooperate  
<span class="move-trigger">When you assist of your companions in an act,</span> you grant them  
Advantage to any rolls made as part of it, but you are both fully  
affected by any costs or consequences.  
Multiple people can Cooperate with the same person at once, that  
person simply gains additional Advantage per person. You can do this  
before your ally resolves the Move, not after.  
Push Yourself  
<span class="move-trigger">When you put all of your effort into one act,</span> roll with Advantage.  
Then after the roll you take a condition from the strain (which ignores  
Armor).  
  
### Settle In  
<span class="move-trigger">When you settle in to rest as a group,</span> whether it’s taking a short  
break, sleeping overnight, or relaxing for weeks, the GM advances the  
Ominous Forces. Then, if anyone has 5 or more XP, they Level Up. If  
you have enough XP, you can Level Up multiple times at once.  
<span class="move-trigger">When you’ve finished resting and resume adventuring,</span> remove all  
your conditions and refresh your undamaged Armor.  
  
## Peripheral Moves  
  
### End of Session  
At the end of each session, answer the following questions as a group:  
- Did we discover something new and important about the world or characters?  
- Did we newly visit or significantly alter a memorable location?  
- Did we overcome a notable obstacle, enemy, or challenge?  
For each “yes” answer, everyone marks 1 XP.  
Lastly, mark 1 XP if you accomplished your Drive.  
  
### Crumble  
<span class="move-trigger">When you mark your last condition (other than Armor),</span> your life is  
untenable.  
<span class="move-trigger">When your life is untenable,</span> from conditions or otherwise, you’re out  
of the action for a while. Say how and choose one from the list below:

through a Level Up. You still gain XP from rolling with it.

If you’re not dead, remove all conditions that aren’t Locked. The GM will advance the Ominous Forces and say when you’re back in the action.

location.

- You are exhausted or distracted. All traveling PCs take a condition  
from fatigue.  
- You are noticed, by your quarry or by someone else, and they act  
accordingly.  
- You are impeded. A significant obstacle stands between you and  
your quarry.  
  
### Connect  
When you declare you know an NPC who could help and go looking  
for them, roll **+CHA**. If you also declare that you Favor them, gain  
Advantage on the roll.  
On a **10+** they could do what you need and they aren’t hard to find.  
On a **7-9** they could do what you need, but the GM will choose one:  
- They have a grudge against you or aren’t entirely willing to trust  
you.  
- They’re already caught up in some sort of trouble.  
- They’re far off, hiding, trapped, or hard to find.

others, you may spend 1 Wealth to roll with Advantage.

## Chase Moves  
### Start the Chase  
<span class="move-trigger">When you enter a chase,</span> either in pursuit or escape, you and your  
adversary form separate ‘sides’ that both start with 0 Edge. A chase  
usually has two sides, the chaser(s) and the chased, but there may be  
more.  
When you Cooperate in a chase:  
- If you are not part of the Chase, you must join a side of it, and are  
involved in that side’s Edge, conclusion and consequences.  
- If you are already part of the chase, you must Push Yourself to  
Cooperate.  
Gain the Edge  
<span class="move-trigger">When you try to get ahead in a chase,</span> say how much Edge you risk (1  
to 3), and roll...  
- **+STR** if you create or destroy obstacles.  
- **+DEX** if you sprint, hide or maneuver.  
- **+INT** if you distract or misdirect.  
- **+WIS** if you watch or listen.  
- **+CHA** if you disguise or provoke.  
On a **10+** your side gains that Edge.  
On a **7-9** your side and an opposing side both gain that Edge. If there  
are multiple opposing sides, you choose which one gains it.  
On a **6-** an opposing side gains that Edge, the GM will say which.  
Then, unless a side has 3 or more Edge, the chase continues and the  
GM describes what happens next.  
  
### It’s Over  
<span class="move-trigger">When any side in a chase has 3 or more Edge,</span> the chase comes to an  
end. Whoever has the most Edge succeeds in escaping or catching  
their quarry. If multiple sides tie for the most Edge, the side with the  
most PCs wins (just barely). If that is also tied, then the PC that last  
Gained the Edge chooses one side to win and another to gain **+1** Edge  
for the purposes of spending it below.  
Losing sides can spend their Edge 1-for-1 to:  
- Learn something about another party (where they will go, who  
leads them, how to escape them now, etc.)  
- Have the chase end somewhere Advantageous for them  
(reinforcements, a trap or lair, an intervening third party, etc.)  
- Grant Advantage Forward to all PCs on their side.  
- Inflict Disadvantage Forward on all PCs on an opposing side.  
  
### Avalanche  
<span class="move-trigger">When you navigate an imminent environmental danger (ongoing trap,rockslide, wildfire, etc.),</span> use the Chase Moves as normal but with the following changes:  
- When you Gain the Edge using knowledge or out-of-the-box thinking, roll **+INT**.  
- If the environment’s side loses the chase, it may not spend Edge to Learn something of another side, but may spend Edge to inflict 1 Condition to all characters on another side, including PCs.  
- Every PC on the losing side Crumbles.  
  
## Favor Moves  
[[Favor|Favor]]  
  
### Gratify  
<span class="move-trigger">When you accomplish a significant task for someone,</span> choose two if  
you Favor them, or one if you don’t:  
- Gain 1 XP  
- You no longer Favor them  
- They Favor you  
- You get to ask them two questions as if you Scrutinized them  
### Refuse  
<span class="move-trigger">When you act against someone you Favor or deny their request,</span>  
roll **+nothing**.  
On a **10+** choose one.  
On a **7-9** choose two.  
On a **6-** all three.  
- Someone else no longer Favors you,  
the GM will say who.  
- It will cost you or come back to bite you - the GM will say how  
now or when revealed.  
- You have Disadvantage Forward against them.  
### Antagonize  
<span class="move-trigger">When you insult,</span> injure, or disappoint someone who Favors you, they  
no longer do.  
Appease  
<span class="move-trigger">When you would Favor someone you already Favor,</span> choose one  
instead:  
- Heal them of one condition; describe how you do so.  
- Gain Advantage Forward to aid them or accomplish something  
for them.  
  
  
## Follower Moves   
[[Followers|Followers]]  
### Endeavor    
<span class="move-trigger">When your Follower does a dangerous task alone,</span> they do it to the    
best of their ability, but are taken out of the action (trapped, injured,    
distracted, etc.). The GM will say how.    
### Assist    
<span class="move-trigger">When you call on your Follower to help you with a task,</span> roll with    
Advantage, but they are also exposed to the costs or consequences    
of your Move. Then the GM will invoke one of their Costs, and the    
follower will be unwilling or unable to Assist you again until it is    
fulfilled.    
### Command    
When you order your Follower to do something contrary to their    
instincts, want or costs, roll **+CHA**. If they Favor you, you may use up    
their Favor to gain Advantage on the roll.    
On a **10+** they do it as well as you can expect.    
On a **7-9** the GM chooses one:    
- The experience endangers them; they do it but are out of the    
action for some time.    
- They complain loudly, now or later, and demand compensation or    
your Favor.    
- It takes them longer than expected, is done shoddily, or it will cost    
you later.
