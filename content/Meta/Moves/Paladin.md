Starting Moves You have all of these.  
  
## Armed and Ready  
Ignore the Clumsy tag on armor you wear.  
### Devout Virtues  
You adhere to a strict moral code that grants you power beyond that wielded by normal folk. Each virtue has a vow that must be kept and a boon it grants you. Choose two of the following virtues:  
• Courage: Refuse to let those who have power abuse it. While you physically stand in defense of another, they will not be targeted or harmed.  
• Honor: Never harm the helpless or unaware. When you Decree an enemy to surrender or repent, you can treat a 6- as a 7-9.  
• Justice: Suffer not a crime unpunished. When you question a captive or friendly individual, you know if they’re lying.  
• Loyalty: Remain true to your word and to your allies. When you speak the truth, none can doubt you. They might deny it out loud, but in their hearts they recognise your conviction.  
• Mercy: Let no innocent creature suffer unaided in your presence. When you heal someone else, you are also healed of one  
condition.  
• Purity: Abstain from mortal pleasures and finery. You are immune to all maladies, such as poisons, diseases, and curses.  
### Chains of Faith  
Whenever you fail to act in accordance to one of your Devout Virtues, depending on the severity of your actions, you may lose access to that vow and its associated benefits until you atone for your  
misdeeds. The GM will tell you what you must do.  
### Decree  
When you command an order to an NPC, roll+CHA. On a 10+ choose two before they flee, attack, or follow your order. On a 7-9 choose one before they flee, attack, or follow your order.  
• If they do anything other than follow your order, gain Advantage Forward against them.  
• They reveal a piece of relevant information to you (unwittingly or otherwise).  
• They cannot flee.  
### Healing Hands  
When you treat someone with Supplies or Medicine, choose one additional effect:  
• It ignores the Slow tag, taking a few moments rather than minutes  
• Heal them of an additional Condition  
• The patient gains Advantage Forward (PCs only)  
  
## Advanced Moves   
You may choose one when you Level Up.  
### Aid for Aid  
When you treat someone with Supplies or Medicine, if they didn’t already Favor you they do now.  
### Bloodhound  
When you Examine outlaws, evil creatures, or sworn enemies, you may ask one question listed below in addition to your normal question. The GM will always answer it truthfully, even on a 6-.  
• Where are they located?  
• What is a vulnerability of theirs?  
• What are they planning?  
• Who is close to turning on them?  
### Divine Favor  
You have gained the notice of a deity. Gain the Cleric’s Divine Agent and Invocation Moves. Learn 1 Invocation now and gain your deity’s  
Favor. You can only have a maximum of 3 Invocations known.  
### Duel of the Fates  
When you Decree to a sworn enemy that they fight you one-on-one, here and now, on a 7+ you can make an additional choice and can also choose from these additional options:  
• They won’t use cheats or tricks during the fight  
• You gain +1 Armor against them during the fight  
• The fight counts as intimate and prying conversation with regards to Scrutinizing them  
### Embolden  
When you give an inspiring speech to your allies before facing a dire threat, roll+CHA. On a 10+ you and each ally gains 2 Inspiration. On a  
7-9 you and each ally gains 1 Inspiration and the GM gains 2 Fear. On a 6- the GM gains 3 Fear. During the conflict, you and allies can spend  
1 of their own Inspiration to:  
• Act fearlessly against terrifying foes or odds.  
• Gain +1 Armor  
• Make their attack ignore Armor During the battle, the GM can spend 1 Fear to:  
• Have you or an ally roll with Disadvantage  
• Have an enemy inflict an additional condition on an attack  
### Executioner  
When you Decree and your target chooses to attack, or when a Duel of the Fates begins, you may immediately inflict a Piercing condition  
onto your target.  
### Healthy Distrust  
Whenever you Defy magic wielded by your foes, treat any result of a 6- as a 7-9.  
### Improvised Care  
You can spend uses of Adventuring gear as if they were Supplies.  
### Last Stand  
When you mark your fourth condition, immediately refresh all of your Armor.  
### Quest  
When you dedicate yourself to a mission, describe what the dedication looks like and state what you set out to do. The GM will give you an associated blessing. While you stay true to your goal, this  
blessing remains yours. At the end of each session, gain 1 XP if you’ve made significant progress on your quest but haven’t completed it.  
When you complete your Quest, immediately lose your blessing and either gain 3 XP, heal 3 conditions, or heal a locked condition.  
### Robin  
You have taken on a young Apprentice (Page 26). When your Apprentice Assists you in a task, on a 12+ you both heal 1 condition.  
The Only Thing They Fear When you Engage or Let Fly, on a 12+ your foe also Fears you. When  
you Compel or Decree someone who Fears you, you can use up that Fear for a +2 bonus to the roll.  
### There Are No Chains On Me  
When you go out of your way to violate one of your Virtues, instead of losing access to its benefit you alter the virtue to fit your action. It  
is up to you how ‘virtuous’ the new vow is at all. When you change Playbooks, you can keep any and all altered Virtues if you wish. Once  
you have altered a Virtue you may no longer take any more paladin Advanced Moves when you Level Up.  
### Virtuous  
Gain another Divine Virtue.  
### Grail Hunting   
(Requires Level 10+)  
When you Quest, receive two Blessings instead of one.  
### Smite Evil   
(Requires Level 10+)  
When you condemn an enemy beyond hope, redemption, or salvation, your attacks against them always inflict an extra condition.
