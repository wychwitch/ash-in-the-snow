Starting Moves You have all of these.  
  
## Armed and Ready  
Ignore the Clumsy tag on armor you wear.  
### Devout Virtues  
You adhere to a strict moral code that grants you power beyond that wielded by normal folk. Each virtue has a vow that must be kept and a boon it grants you. Choose two of the following virtues:  
- **Courage:** Refuse to let those who have power abuse it. <span class="move-trigger">While you physically stand in defense of another,</span> they will not be targeted or harmed.  
- **Honor:** Never harm the helpless or unaware. <span class="move-trigger">When you Decree an enemy to surrender or repent,</span> you can treat a **6-** as a **7-9**.  
- **Justice:** Suffer not a crime unpunished. <span class="move-trigger">When you question a captive or friendly individual,</span> you know if they’re lying.  
- **Loyalty:** Remain true to your word and to your allies. <span class="move-trigger">When you speak the truth, none can doubt you. They might deny it out loud,</span> but in their hearts they recognize your conviction.  
- **Mercy:** Let no innocent creature suffer unaided in your presence. <span class="move-trigger">When you heal someone else,</span> you are also healed of one condition.  
- **Purity:** Abstain from mortal pleasures and finery. You are immune to all maladies, such as poisons, diseases, and curses.  
### Chains of Faith  
<span class="move-trigger">Whenever you fail to act in accordance to one of your Devout Virtues,</span> depending on the severity of your actions, you may lose access to that vow and its associated benefits until you atone for your  
misdeeds. The GM will tell you what you must do.  
### Decree  
<span class="move-trigger">When you command an order to an NPC,</span> roll **+CHA**. On a **10+** choose two before they flee, attack, or follow your order. On a **7-9** choose one before they flee, attack, or follow your order.  
- If they do anything other than follow your order, gain Advantage Forward against them.  
- They reveal a piece of relevant information to you (unwittingly or otherwise).  
- They cannot flee.  
### Healing Hands  
<span class="move-trigger">When you treat someone with Supplies or Medicine,</span> choose one additional effect:  
- It ignores the Slow tag, taking a few moments rather than minutes

### Bloodhound  
<span class="move-trigger">When you Examine outlaws,</span> evil creatures, or sworn enemies, you may ask one question listed below in addition to your normal question. The GM will always answer it truthfully, even on a **6-**.

<span class="move-trigger">When you dedicate yourself to a mission,</span> describe what the dedication looks like and state what you set out to do. The GM will give you an associated blessing. <span class="move-trigger">While you stay true to your goal,</span> this  
blessing remains yours. At the end of each session, gain 1 XP if you’ve made significant progress on your quest but haven’t completed it.

### There Are No Chains On Me  
<span class="move-trigger">When you go out of your way to violate one of your Virtues,</span> instead of losing access to its benefit you alter the virtue to fit your action. It  
is up to you how ‘virtuous’ the new vow is at all. <span class="move-trigger">When you change Playbooks,</span> you can keep any and all altered Virtues if you wish. Once
