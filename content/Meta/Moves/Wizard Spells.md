You start with two known spells. See the Evoke a Spell Starting Move on Page 75 for details.  
Only one Ongoing spell or invocation can normally be upheld at a time, though you can still use other spells that aren’t Ongoing. You can stop an Ongoing spell any time.  
The Risk of a spell usually only happens when you choose it on a 7-9, but something similar or worse may happen on a 6-.  
A spell’s Greater effect only happens when certain Advanced Moves unlock it.  
### Charm  
A creature you touch is bewitched into treating you as a trusted friend, and they Favor you for as long as the spell lasts. Once the spell ends, they know the effects of your magic.  
Risk: The entranced creature, though your friend, still doesn’t Favor  
you deep down.  
Greater: They don’t remember the effects of your magic when the spell ends.  
### Darkness (Ongoing)  
A nearby area you designate is blanketed by supernatural darkness  
while the spell lasts. Torches, lanterns, and other mundane lights within the area are also snuffed out.  
Risk: Something appears alongside the darkness; the GM will say what.  
Greater: Even magical lights cannot pierce the darkness.  
### Entangle (Ongoing)  
The legs of a nearby creature, or close group of creatures, becomes ensnared by roots, webs, or magical bindings.  
Risk: They can break free with a few moments of concentrated effort.  
Greater: The spell also hurts them via thorns, choking, poison, etc.  
### Fireball  
You evoke a mighty ball of flame that envelops your target and everyone near it, hurting them (Fiery, Area).  
Risk: The blast effects either much more or much less than anticipated, the GM will say.  
Greater: The fireball inflicts an extra condition.  
### Forcecage (Ongoing)  
A nearby creature is held immobile in an unbreakable forcefield. While the spell is ongoing the caged creature cannot be harmed and can detect your thoughts. You cannot leave sight of the cage or it will vanish.  
Risk: You cannot act while the spell is Ongoing (besides dismissing it)  
Greater: The cage is large enough to also encompass those within a few paces of the target.  
### Guardian (Ongoing)  
You conjure a being of magical energy (see Followers on Page 20).  
By default it is a Warrior with the Brutality cost, looks like a ghostly humanoid, and attacks your enemies relentlessly. Your Guardian  
persists until destroyed, dismissed, or you conjure another. Choose two features:  
• Adaptable: Takes the appearance and form of a previously-  
encountered creature of your choice, including size, limbs, etc.  
• Skilled: It gains another Quality (can choose multiple times)  
• Disciplined: It will follow your commands intelligently.  
Risk: The construct also gains the Unstable cost (They can sometimes be a danger to you, and you have to be prepared to put up with that.)  
Greater: You can choose an additional feature.  
### Immunity (Ongoing)  
Name one specific source of harm, such as burning, cutting, lightning, poisonous gas, or mundane projectiles; for as long as this spell is ongoing, you are immune to harm from that source (as well as any secondary effects; choking smoke, hypothermia, etc.).  
Risk: You gain +2 Armor against it but are not immune.  
Greater: Nearby allies are equally protected.  
### Invisibility  
You or an ally you touch becomes invisible for the scene or until they attack.  
Risk: Either one creature can still see them clear as day, or anyone perceptive enough might notice a shimmer; the GM will say which.  
Greater: The effect is Ongoing and persists after attacking. It still only lasts for the scene.  
### Magic Missile (Ongoing)  
You send bolts of magical energy at your enemies (Near, Distinctive, Piercing). While this is Ongoing, you can Let Fly by rolling+SPELL  
instead of +DEX.  
Risk: The missiles aren’t Piercing.  
Greater: Your missiles gain the Far and Forceful tags.  
### Mind Meld  
You form a telepathic bond with a creature you touch, allowing you to share thoughts and emotions across any distance. You can only have one bond at a time, and may dismiss it whenever you like.  
Risk: When one of you suffers a condition that isn’t absorbed by Armor (other than from Pushing Yourself) so does the other, though they don’t have to be the same condition.  
Greater: You can also share vision and other senses through the link.  
### Mirror Image  
You conjure two nearby illusory duplicates for the scene that mimic your actions and appearance. Each illusion counts as +1 Armor against  
physical harm and cannot be Pierced, but can be bypassed through Area attacks. When you use an illusion’s Armor it dissipates. When  
you evoke this spell again all previously conjured duplicates dissipate.  
Risk: The illusion is flawed, and can be bypassed with Piercing attacks.  
Greater: You conjure three illusory duplicates instead of two.  
### Polymorph (Ongoing)  
Your touch transforms a willing creature into another non-magical creature until the end of the scene. Work with the GM to determine  
the strengths, adaptations, and weaknesses of the new form.  
Risk: The creature’s mind will be altered too, or the form has an  
unintended and unforeseen quality - the GM will say which and how.  
Greater: The change continues until you release it, or the target doesn’t have to be willing, your choice.  
### Sleep  
A single powerful creature or 3-6 weaker creatures that you can see falls asleep. Only creatures capable of sleeping are affected, and they  
will awake if disturbed (loud noises, jostling, pain, etc.).  
Risk: The effect is fleeting and they will awaken soon.  
Greater: It affects two powerful creatures or up to 20 weaker creatures.  
### Spellblade (Ongoing)  
You conjure a weapon of pure magic, describe it and give it one or two  
range tags and Piercing.  
Risk: The weapon’s magic is unstable and it isn’t Piercing.  
Greater: The weapon also has 2 traits from the Signature Weapon enhancements (see Assets on Page 29).
