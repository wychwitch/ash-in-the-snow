You start with two of these known, see the Invocation Starting Move  
on Page 45 for details.  
Only one Ongoing invocation or spell can be maintained at a time.  
The Risk of an Invocation usually only happens when you choose it on  
a **7-9**, but something like it or worse may happen when the GM says  
what happens on a **6-**.  
An Invocation’s Greater effect only happens when certain Advanced  
Moves unlock it.  
  
### Bestow Curse  
A foe you touch has their Armor reduced to 0 or is struck by some  
supernatural disease, blindness, or another affliction for a few  
minutes.  
**Risk:** You also suffer the effects of the curse.  
**Greater:** On a **12+**, the effect lasts as long as you’d like, including  
permanently.  
  
### Bless  
For the remainder of this scene, an ally gains Advantage Forward and  
either **+1** Armor or **+1** condition inflicted the next time they hurt  
someone - you choose when you Bless them.  
**Risk:** You also receive Disadvantage Forward.  
**Greater:** They have Advantage Ongoing for the scene, instead of just  
Forward.  
  
### Cause Fear (Ongoing)  
Name an individual or a type of mortal creature. While they can see  
you they are filled with dread, causing them to recoil and back away -  
the weak and cowardly among them must outright flee.  
**Risk:** Instead of simply recoiling or fleeing, they might act aggressively,  
rashly, or unpredictably.  
**Greater:** On a **12+**, even the mighty and strong-willed must flee.  
  
### Contact Spirits  
You speak with a departed soul whose body is nearby or whom you  
knew when they were alive. Their spirit manifests for the scene, and  
will answer any one question you ask to the best of its ability before  
it returns.  
**Risk:** Their answers are vague or veiled, as they are either unable or  
unwilling to answer you clearly.  
**Greater:** On a **12+**, you can ask them any number of questions for the  
scene.  
  
### Dismiss  
A nearby otherworldly entity or spirit is banished from the world or  
back to whatever tethers it here.  
**Risk:** As it leaves it manifests a curse, harm, or a way to return later,  
the GM will say how.  
**Greater:** On a **12+**, ordinary entities are utterly destroyed, and the  
strongest are driven away with whatever tethers them here destroyed.  
  
### Empower (Ongoing)  
Filled with your deity’s power, you or an ally treats one stat as **+3** and  
ignores conditions on it (both for rolls and for XP).  
**Risk:** Once the effect ends, the one(s) who benefited suffers two  
conditions from exhaustion.  
**Greater:** You can affect both yourself and ally. The same stat is  
empowered for both of you.  
  
### Illuminate (Ongoing)  
A magical light emits from you or something you touch, piercing  
darkness, illusions, and trickery.  
**Risk:** The enemies of your deity can sense this light from a great  
distance.  
**Greater:** The light is blinding to all who look at it and enemies of your  
deity can’t bear to be near it.  
  
### Message  
A message you speak is instantly delivered to a person of your  
choosing, no matter where they are.  
**Risk:** It won’t be delivered instantly.  
**Greater:** When they receive the message, they can also respond with  
a single message in kind to you.  
  
### Procure  
You miraculously have just the mundane item you need, as if you had  
spent 1 use of Adventuring Gear. Perhaps it was in your pack or sitting  
nearby.  
**Risk:** You don’t have exactly what you need, but something similar.  
**Greater:** The item is of superb make, perhaps with an additional  
feature or quality.  
  
### Safeguard (Ongoing)  
An ally either gains Advantage Ongoing to Defy or is protected from  
something pertaining to your deity’s domains (you choose when this  
is invoked).  
**Risk:** When this effect ends, those affected must fulfill a demand of  
your deity or suffer a condition.  
**Greater:** On a **12+** all your allies are affected.  
  
### Sanctuary (Ongoing)  
As you perform this invocation, you walk the perimeter of an area,  
consecrating it to your deity. As long as you stay within this area, you  
know when someone enters it or when someone within it acts with  
malicious intent.  
**Risk:** You only know when someone within the area acts with  
malicious intent, but not when someone enters.  
**Greater:** On a **12+**, none can enter the sanctuary without your express  
knowledge and consent.  
  
### Speak in Tongues  
You can clearly speak with and understand any sentient creature for  
the scene.  
**Risk:** You can understand them, or they you, pick one.  
**Greater:** Nearby allies can also be affected.  
  
### Transcend Surroundings (Ongoing)  
A nearby physical obstacle, hazard, or environment no longer poses  
any threat to you.  
**Risk:** It does still pose a threat but you have Advantage Ongoing to  
Defy it.  
**Greater:** The effect extends to nearby allies.  
  
### Unleash Wrath  
Your deity’s power harms an enemy, usually inflicting a condition  
(Forceful, Distinctive, Piercing).  
**Risk:** It isn’t Piercing.  
**Greater:** On a **12+** they are also briefly stunned.
