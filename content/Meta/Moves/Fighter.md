## Starting Moves   
You have all of these.  
  
### Armed and Ready

### Battle Momentum  
You perfectly understand the back and forth rhythm of a fight. When you suffer or inflict harm as part of a fight (even if it’s absorbed with  
Armor), gain 1 Momentum. Anytime during a fight, you may spend the amount of Momentum in brackets for the following:  
- **(3)** Restore 1 of your Armor  
- **(3)** Inflict an extra condition on an attack  
- **(2)** Gain Advantage Forward to Engage or Let Fly

### Particular Set of Skills  
<span class="move-trigger">When you Compel with threats of violence,</span> roll with Advantage.  
### Demolitionist  
<span class="move-trigger">When you want to destroy an object,</span> be it a building, magical artifact, or obstacle, tell the GM what it is. It is always possible, but the GM  
will give you 1 to 4 of the following requirements (separated by “ANDs” and “ORs”);  
- It’s going to take hours/days/weeks.  
- First you must .  
- You’ll need help from .  
- You’ll need to use .

volcano.
