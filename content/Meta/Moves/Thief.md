Starting Moves You have all of these.  
  
### Dirty Fighting  
<span class="move-trigger">When you have Advantage on Engage,</span> you may roll **+DEX** instead of **STR**.  
### Poisoner  
You’ve mastered the care and use of a poison. Choose one example poison from the list below, or work with the GM to create one.  
Poisons you have mastered are not Dangerous for you to use. <span class="move-trigger">When you Settle In,</span> you can create a dose of each of your mastered poisons.  
- **Oil of Taggit:** Must be consumed. The target falls into a light sleep.  
- **Bloodweed:** Requires contact. Until they are cured, the first time the target would hurt someone each scene, they inflict no conditions.  
- **Goldenroot:** Must be consumed. The target treats the next person they see as a trusted ally, until proved otherwise.  
- **Serpent’s Tears:** Requires contact. The target takes 1 extra condition when hurt until they are cured.  
- Custom!  
### Wanted  
Authorities are intent on capturing you for your past crimes, whether you truly commited them or were framed. You start with 0 Heat, and your Heat cannot rise above 4. The GM may increase your Heat as a consequence of another Move, usually  
involving public attention. <span class="move-trigger">When you Push Yourself,</span> instead of taking a condition you may gain 1 Heat by leaving evidence or witness of your presence.  
<span class="move-trigger">When you have 4 Heat,</span> law enforcement knows where you are and are moving to capture you, the GM will decide when and how they appear. After they have been defeated, escaped from, bargained with,  
etc., reset your Heat to 0.  
<span class="move-trigger">When you Settle In after covering your tracks,</span> reduce your Heat by 1.  
### Tricks of the Trade  
<span class="move-trigger">When you bypass security measures in order to steal something or trespass somewhere,</span> roll **+DEX**. On a **10+** you do it quickly and cleanly. On a **7-9** you do it, but choose one.  
- Authorities will discover your trail, gain 1 Heat  
- Someone nearby is alerted of your presence  
- There is an unexpected danger, trap, or ambush inside  
  
## Advanced Moves   
You may choose one when you Level Up.  
### Ace Up Your Sleeve  
<span class="move-trigger">When you cheat in a game of chance,</span> roll **+DEX**. On a **10+** you decide the outcome of the game. On a **7-9** you still decide the outcome of the game but choose one:  
- Someone will try to get payback later  
- You’re not welcome to play here anymore  
- You gain 1 Heat  
### Appraiser  
<span class="move-trigger">Whenever you Examine an object,</span> you can always also ask “How much Wealth is this worth?”. Additionally, Valuable items you sell are  
worth an additional 1 Wealth.  
### Case the Joint  
<span class="move-trigger">When you Examine a location with the intention of breaking in and/or stealing something,</span> instead of asking the GM any one question you may ask all of the questions below.  
- What is my best way in and out?  
- What’s the greatest danger here?  
- What’s out of place here?  
- Where do they keep the valuables?  
### Deep Pockets  
Once per session, you can pull out something from your pockets that you forgot about until just now, as if you had used Adventuring Gear.  
<span class="move-trigger">When you conceal a small object on your person,</span> no one can find it unless you are bound, stripped, and thoroughly searched. You can conceal up to your **DEX** stat in items at the same time this way.  
### Honorless  
<span class="move-trigger">When you Refuse (see Favor Moves),</span> roll **+CHA** instead of **+nothing**.  
Additionally, on a **10+** you can choose none.  
### Lair  
You gain a Hideout with the additional unique feature:  
Safehouse - When you Settle In by covering your tracks and staying  
low at this Hideout you may decrease your Heat by 2 instead of 1.  
### Poison Expert  
You’ve mastered two more poisons from Poisoner.  
### Pursuer  
A significant NPC now leads the effort in your capture. This Pursuer will relentlessly chase you wherever you go, and always leads the  
charge whenever law enforcement moves against you. <span class="move-trigger">When you reset your Heat to 0 after dealing with your Pursuer,</span> first gain XP equal to your Heat. Next time they’ll be back stronger or better  
prepared. <span class="move-trigger">When your Pursuer is no longer able or willing to hunt you, you temporarily lose access to the rest of this Move. Anytime while Settling In,</span> you may tell the GM that you have gained a new Pursuer and regain access to this Move.  
### Prowler  
<span class="move-trigger">While you move or act quietly and/or stealthily,</span> you are generally unnoticed by ordinary NPCs and have Advantage to Defy being noticed. <span class="move-trigger">When you search for a hiding space,</span> the GM will tell you  
where the best spot is.  
### Reflexes  
You always act first when the action starts, even when surprised or otherwise caught off-guard.  
### Rooftop Routes  
<span class="move-trigger">When you Gain the Edge in a Chase,</span> after the roll you may gain 1 Heat to treat a **6-** as a **7-9** or a **7-9** as a **10+**.  
### Suspicious Gaze  
<span class="move-trigger">When you think something’s wrong and scan your surroundings,</span> ask the GM “Is there a trap or ambush here? If so, where would it come  
from?” They will answer honestly, and you roll with Advantage to thwart the trap or ambush before it can be brought to bear.  
### Tall Tales  
<span class="move-trigger">When you tell an outrageous lie that nobody in their right mind would believe,</span> roll **+CHA**. On a **10+** all nearby NPCs believe you  
anyway, at least until they see or hear something that convinces them otherwise. On a **7-9** they’ll be fooled, but not for long.  
### The Smoulder  
You always look good. Even if you’re wet, dirty, beat-up, or otherwise disheveled, you still look great. When you use your impeccable good-  
looks and considerable charms to Compel someone, treat them as if they Favor you, but gain 1 Heat as you are burned into their memory.  
### Trust Me  
As long as you show a friendly face, anyone not already actively hostile towards you will treat you as a friend until proven otherwise.  
Anything you say will be accepted as open honesty unless hard evidence is given to the contrary.  
### Thieves Guild   
(Requires Level **10+**)  
You have garnered a handful of like-minded accomplices. Gain a Follower with the additional Quality - Gang: This follower is a small  
group of individuals instead of a single one. If all of them are present they can assist two PCs at once. Additionally, once per session you  
can declare that your gang was already working on something as if they were an Assistant asset (see Page 27).
