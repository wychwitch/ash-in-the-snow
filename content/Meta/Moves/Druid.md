## Starting Moves   
You have all of these.  
  
### At One With The World  
You can speak with animals and Scrutinize and Compel them. You also don’t require food or drink.  
### Attuned Creatures  
You begin play with two Attuned Creatures of your choice. Each has a species name and an Instinct. When you Level Up, you may add two  
Attuned Creatures to your list instead of another benefit.  
Instinct examples: smash and tear, fly free without care, prey upon the weak and isolated, consume and devour, skulk and ambush, weave webs  
and victimize the foolish, assault and challenge the brave or strong.  
### Commune  
<span class="move-trigger">When you spend some time in a place,</span> connecting with nearby creatures and spirits, roll **+WIS**. You will be granted a vision of significance to you, your allies, or the spirits around you, the GM will  
describe it.  
On a **10+** the vision will be clear and helpful.  
On a **7-9** the vision is unclear and murky.  
On a **6-** the vision is frightening or traumatic.  
### Shapeshift  
<span class="move-trigger">When you call upon the wilds to change your shape,</span> choose one of your attuned creatures to change into and roll **+WIS**.  
On a **10+** you transform quickly and without issue.  
On a **7-9** you still transform, but you are put in a spot or draw unwanted attention.  
While in an animal shape, you gain any innate abilities and weaknesses of the form; claws, wings, gills, and so on. You also gain the Instinct of your new form. This primal urge is something innate to each creature and becomes a part of you while you are shifted.  
### Resist Instinct  
<span class="move-trigger">When you try to change shape without having fulfilled your Instinct,</span> roll **+WIS**.  
On a **10+** you succeed and are now able to transform. If you’re changing back to normal, you do so. If you’re changing into another creature, roll to Shapeshift.  
On a **7-9** you succeed, but won’t be able to transform back into your  
previous form until you reattune with it by fulfilling its Instinct.
