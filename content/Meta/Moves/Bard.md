### Expressive Conflict  
You wield renowned artistic skill, (music, writing, painting, etc.) which can do more than just capture hearts and minds. Choose two expressions that you know:

- Curse a foe, removing 2 of their unused Armor.

You have 3 Art. <span class="move-trigger">When you Settle In,</span> reset your Art to this number.  
<span class="move-trigger">When you invoke your artistry,</span> you may spend 1 Art and unleash one known expression.  
### Perform  
<span class="move-trigger">When you practice or display your chosen art before an Intelligent audience,</span> roll **+CHA**.  
On a **10+** gain 3 Awe. On a **7-9** gain 2 Awe.  
During or shortly after your performance, you can spend each Awe to name an NPC in the audience and choose one below. You may choose the same NPC multiple times.

### Speak Softly  
<span class="move-trigger">When you Scrutinize someone by speaking openly and honestly with them,</span> you can roll **+CHA** instead of **+WIS**. You may also choose to gain 1 additional Insight, even on a **6-**, but if you do then afterwards they will ask you a question as if they had 1 Insight on you.
