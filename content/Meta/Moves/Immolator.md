## Starting Moves   
You have all of these.  
### Firebrand  
You can move and manipulate fire in a variety of ways - dimming, flaring, sparking, changing color, creating shapes and images, and more. Your fire is Distinctive, Fiery, and Near when you fight with it. Additionally, choose two traits for it:  
- **Adaptable:** Your fire has the  
Intimate and Close tags.  
- **Ambitious:** Your fire has the  
Far tag.  
- **Bold:** Your fire has the Area  
tag.  
- **Restrained:** You and nearby  
allies have **+1** Armor against  
your fire and its effects.  
- **Spontaneous:** You can create fire rather than manipulate what’s already burning.  
<span class="move-trigger">When you Burn a trait,</span> (see Unleash Flames) your fire loses it until you next Settle In.  
### Unleash Flames  
<span class="move-trigger">When you fight using fire as a weapon,</span> roll **+CHA**. On a **10+** you hurt your foe, but choose one. On a **7-9** you hurt your foe, but choose two.  
- You cause unintended collateral damage.  
- You suffer a condition, perhaps due to overexertion or a foe’s counterattack.  
- Choose and Burn one of your fire’s traits  
- Your draw unwanted attention from nearby  
### Captivate  
<span class="move-trigger">When you share an intimate or enchanting moment with someone,</span> usually with time and privacy, roll **+CHA**. On a **10+** you have 2 Charm over them. On a **7-9** you have 1 Charm over them. They can reduce  
your Charm over them by 1 by:  
- Giving you something they think you want.  
- Doing something you tell them to do.  
- Fighting to protect you.  
- Favoring you, but only if they don’t already.  
If they’re an NPC, they can’t act out against you while Charmed. If they’re a PC, you also can spend 1 Charm to inspire or distract them,  
granting them Advantage or Disadvantage on their next roll.  
### From the Ashes  
<span class="move-trigger">When you burn a sacrifice and stare deeply into the flames,</span> ask the GM one question about your sacrifice or something associated with it (owners, loved ones, history, etc.) and roll **+CHA**. On a **10+** you see a clear and detailed vision in the flames that answers your question and related follow-up questions. On a **7-9** you see a brief vision in the flames that answers your question vaguely.  
  
## Advanced Moves   
You may choose one when you Level Up.  
### Agni Kai  
<span class="move-trigger">When you take a condition or mark Armor due to fire or heat,</span> recover one of your Burned traits.  
### Blades of Chaos  
Your fire gains the additional trait - Cruel: Your fire has the Messy and Vicious tags.  
### Burning Hearts  
<span class="move-trigger">When you gaze intensely into someone’s eyes,</span> you may ask them “what is your deepest desire?” Their player will answer with the truth, even if the character does not know or wouldn’t answer.  
### By Fire Be Purged  
<span class="move-trigger">When you burn away a magical enchantment,</span> compulsion or curse, roll **+CHA**. On a **10+** it is destroyed completely. On a **7-9** choose one:  
- It is only cleansed partially or temporarily.  
- The cleansing has left its mark on the subject (if that’s a person they might suffer a condition).  
- The cleansing draws unwanted attention from the magic’s source.  
### Don’t Blink  
<span class="move-trigger">When you stand your ground before a creature of fire,</span> such as an elemental or a dragon, roll **+CHA**. On a **10+** you have earned its tentative respect and it will not attack you (for now). On a **7-9** it won’t attack you for now but it grows impatient. The GM will tell you what to do to be spared its wrath.  
### Dragon of the West  
<span class="move-trigger">When you Defy fire or heat,</span> on a **12+** choose one:  
- Redirect the fire back onto its source.  
- Kindle your own flame, restoring a Burned trait.  
- Ask the GM any one question about the flame or its source.   
### Everburning  
<span class="move-trigger">When you imbue an object with a portion of your fire,</span> it will burn with a dim, heatless flame without being consumed. For each one you choose below, take a cumulative -1 to Unleash Flames rolls until you touch the object and reclaim the flame.  
- The flame is not heatless, the object burns foes when used as a weapon.  
- The flame is bright, and will illuminate shadows, uncover illusions and reveal invisibility.  
- The flame remains connected to you, you can see and hear everything near the object.  
### Eye for Destruction  
At any time, ask the GM “What here is flammable?” They will answer truthfully.  
### Hypnotic  
<span class="move-trigger">When you share a regret,</span> dream, or fear with someone when Captivating them, on a 7+ gain **+1** Charm over them.  
### Infernal  
Your fire gains an additional trait of your choice from Firebrand.  
### Mushu  
You have an animal companion (see Followers on Page 20). This companion has an additional descriptor - Affinity for Fire: This follower cannot be harmed by fire or heat, even of a magical nature.  
### Scorched Earth  
Your fire gains the additional trait - Furious: Your fire Pierces Armor.  
### Smokestep  
<span class="move-trigger">When you obscure yourself with a cloud of smoke,</span> ash or cinders, you can instantly transport yourself anywhere within the cloud, or to  
another nearby cloud.  
### Twice as Bright, Half as Long  
<span class="move-trigger">While channeling your fire,</span> after rolling you may sacrifice something, material or immaterial but always notable, to treat a result of **6-** as a  
 **7-9**, or a result of **7-9** as a **10+**.  
### Twinflame  
You have an additional drive. Write it down next to your original one. This new drive also grants 1 XP if it was accomplished by the end of  
each session. <span class="move-trigger">When you Push Yourself to pursue one of your drives,</span> you may Burn one of your flame’s traits instead of taking a condition.  
### Master of the Flame  
(Requires Level **10+**)  
<span class="move-trigger">When you Unleash Flames,</span> on a **10+** you don’t have to choose any from the list.  
Watch the World Burn (Requires Level **10+**)  
<span class="move-trigger">When you channel the flames and call down a firestorm,</span> tell the GM what you’re sacrificing. The sky opens up and fire pours like rain within  
an area proportionate to your sacrifice; everyone and everything in the area is severely hurt or worse (2-3 conditions). Then roll **+CHA**. On a **10+** you can extinguish the storm with some effort when you so choose. On a **7-9** the fires rage out of control, spreading and growing where they are carried by wind and weather. On a **6-** something cruel, intelligent, and hungry arrives with the storm.  
### Puppetmaster (Requires Level **10+**)  
<span class="move-trigger">When you tell an NPC you have Charm over specifically what you desire,</span> until that desire is fulfilled, pursuing it is the only way they can reduce your Charm on them.
