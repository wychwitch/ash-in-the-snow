## Starting Moves   
You have all of these.  
### Evoke a Spell  
<span class="move-trigger">When you unleash your magical talents,</span> choose a spell you know and roll **+SPELL**. On a **10+** you successfully evoke the spell and its effects  
come to pass. On a **7-9** the spell is still successful but choose one consequence from the list below.  
- The spell’s Risk manifests as well.  
- The spell’s magic drains you. You take -1 Ongoing to Evoke Spells until you next Settle In.  
- Using it puts you in danger or draws unwanted attention, the GM will say how.  
You start with 2 spells known. <span class="move-trigger">When you Level Up,</span> you can choose to Learn a New Spell instead of another benefit.  
### Prestidigitation  
You can easily invoke minor magical effects without issue. Slowly moving small objects, creating minor obvious illusions, generating mild  
heat and sources of light, and other similar feats are all easily within your power without rolling.  
### Ritual  
<span class="move-trigger">When you set out to achieve a powerful magical effect,</span> tell the GM what you’re trying to achieve. Any and all Ritual effects are possible,  
but the GM will give you 1 to 4 of the following conditions (separated by “ANDs” and “ORs”):  
- It’s going to take days/weeks/months.  
- First you must -BLANK-.  
- You’ll need help from -BLANK-.  
- It will require -BLANK-.  
- The effect will be unreliable or limited.  
- You and your allies will risk -BLANK-.  
- You’ll have to destroy to do it.  
<span class="move-trigger">When you perform a Ritual while accessing a source of great magical power,</span> you may ignore one requirement of your choice.   
  
## Advanced Moves   
You may choose one when you Level Up.  
  
### Advise  
<span class="move-trigger">When another PC comes to you for advice and you honestly tell them what you think is best,</span> they gain Advantage Forward to do as you suggest.  
<span class="move-trigger">When you give sound advice to a receptive NPC,</span> roll **+CHA**. On a **10+** they follow your advice as best they can and appreciate it enough to Favor you. On a **7-9** they follow your advice as best they can. On a **6-** they either act against your advise or need your help; the GM will say which and how.  
### Arcane Ward  
You have **+1** Armor against spells and magic.  
Assimilate (requires Dispel Magic or Counterspell)  
<span class="move-trigger">When you Push Yourself to Dispel Magic or Counterspell,</span> on a 7+ you can absorb and store the magical effect for later. The magic can  
then be released like Evoking a Spell, after which the stored magic dissipates. If you release the stored magic immediately after absorbing it, you gain Advantage to Evoke it. You can only store one magical effect at a time.  
### Counterspell  
<span class="move-trigger">When you attempt to counter magic as it is being cast,</span> roll **+SPELL**.  
On a **10+** the magic is successfully countered and doesn’t come to pass.   
On a **7-9** the magic is countered but choose one.  
- You can’t use magic for a short time.  
- The unraveled magic causes some collateral damage or side effects.  
- It’s only partially countered, a weaker version manifests instead.  
### Coven  
<span class="move-trigger">When you Connect with a magical being,</span> on a **7-9** you make the choice instead of the GM. Additionally, gain Advantage Forward when  
dealing with that NPC or their problems.  
### Dispel Magic  
<span class="move-trigger">When you unravel an ongoing magical effect,</span> roll **+SPELL**. On a **10+** choose 3. On a **7-9** choose 2.  
- The dispel is permanent.  
- A weaker version of the magic doesn’t linger.  
- The dispelled magic doesn’t react or lash out.  
- It only takes a moment.  
### Equivalent Exchange   
(cannot take Wild Mastery)  
<span class="move-trigger">When you Push Yourself to Evoke a Spell,</span> your Spell becomes Greater.  
### Even Further Beyond  
Choose a single spell. It always has its Greater effect by default.  
Furthermore, if the Greater effect would be invoked on this spell then  
its effects increase even more; the GM will say how.  
### Familiar  
You have a magical companion as a Follower (see Followers on Page 20). This companion has an additional Quality - Magical: You may use your familiar in place of yourself for the purposes of spell effects and requirements (touch, sight, range, etc.).  
### Ritual Master  
<span class="move-trigger">When you set out to perform a Ritual,</span> you may ask the GM where the nearest source of great magical power is and they will answer you honestly. Additionally, sources of great magical power let you ignore two Ritual requirements instead of one.  
### Sanctum  
<span class="move-trigger">When you Settle In,</span> you can create your own place of power for the purposes of the Ritual Move. Describe to the GM what kind of power it is and how you’re binding it to this place. In return, the GM will tell you of someone or something that will have an interest in your activities.  
### Showoff  
<span class="move-trigger">When you wow an audience with a display of your magic,</span> roll **+SPELL**.  
On a **10+** choose 2. On a **7-9** choose 1.  
- An NPC you name is present among the crowd.  
- Your allies have Advantage Ongoing against the crowd while you keep them focused on you.  
- You are given a gift equivalent to 1 Wealth.  
### Spellbook  
<span class="move-trigger">When you Settle In,</span> you can exchange one known Spell for another.  
### Wild Mastery   
(cannot take Equivalent Exchange)  
<span class="move-trigger">When you Evoke a Spell,</span> on a **10+** you may treat it as a **7-9** to make the spell Greater.  
### Multitasker   
(Requires Level **10+**)  
You can maintain up to two Ongoing spells at a time.  
### Unlimited Power   
(Requires Level **10+**)  
<span class="move-trigger">When you perform a Ritual,</span> you may take a condition as if you Pushed Yourself to ignore one of its requirements. You may do this multiple  
times
