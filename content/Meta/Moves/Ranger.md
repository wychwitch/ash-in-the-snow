## Starting Moves   
You have all of these.  
  
### Citizen of the Wild  
<span class="move-trigger">When you Track Down,</span> roll **+WIS** instead of **+nothing**, and make one fewer choice on any result.  
### Ready For Anything  
You have 4 Prep. <span class="move-trigger">When you Settle In,</span> reset your Prep to 4. You can spend Prep to use a Flashback or Honed Technique.  
### Flashback  
<span class="move-trigger">When you retroactively declare how you prepared for something in advance,</span> spend Prep as determined by the GM using the guideline below. As a consequence during a flashback the GM may say  
something costs extra Prep. If you spend more Prep than you have, take a condition for each remaining Prep.  
- 1 Prep - Ordinary action, easy opportunity, no rolls required, a  
short time ago.  
- 2 Prep - Complex action, unlikely opportunity, one roll required,  
some time ago.  
- 3 Prep - Elaborate action, special opportunity, several rolls required, a long time ago.  
### Honed Techniques  
You have learned many skills from your time in the wilderness. You may spend 1 Prep to use a known Technique at any time without rolling. Choose two Techniques that you know:  
- **Avoid:** Roll with Advantage when Defying a physical threat.  
- **Exploit:** Make an attack Pierce Armor.  
- **Impart:** Message or signal someone nearby, covertly or openly.  
- **Maneuver:** Rapidly move somewhere nearby, overcoming any  
natural obstacle or environment in the way.  
- **Snare:** Trap someone or something in place for a short time (you  
may spend your Trap Kit instead of Prep to use this technique).  
- **Trick:** Manipulate someone nearby to move somewhere specific.  
- **Vanish:** Disappear within a nearby dense or obscuring environment.  
<span class="move-trigger">When you Level Up,</span> you may choose to learn an additional Technique instead of another benefit.  
### Bestiary Knowledge  
<span class="move-trigger">When you first encounter a beast or monster you are familiar with (your call),</span> you may ask the GM one question about it, and they’ll tell  
you the truth.  
  
## Advanced Moves   
You may choose one when you Level Up.  
### Animal Whisperer  
<span class="move-trigger">When you approach a dangerous animal carefully and peacefully roll **+WIS**. On a **10+** it will not attack unless provoked. On a **7-9** you must first offer it something it wants (food,</span> territory, etc.).  
### Athelas  
<span class="move-trigger">When you forage for medicine and treat someone with it,</span> roll **+WIS**.  
On a **10+** you find just what you need - heal them of 1 Condition (slow) as if you used Supplies. On a **7-9** you find something that will do for now - they are able to ignore 1 condition for the scene.  
### Backup Plans  
Your Prep resets to 6 instead of 4.  
### Big Game Hunter  
There is always some creature or monster nearby that needs to be dealt with. <span class="move-trigger">Whenever you like, tell the GM there is a monster in the region. Then answer three of the questions below,</span> and the GM will answer the remaining three questions in secret.  
- How big is it?  
- How many are there?  
- Where is its lair?  
- What are its defenses?  
- What can it do?  
- What valuables might it have?  
<span class="move-trigger">When you show authorities proof that the threat is dealt with,</span> gain 3 Wealth.  
### Camouflaged  
You have Advantage to Gain the Edge in the wilderness. <span class="move-trigger">When you move slowly, carefully, and calmly,</span> you make no noise and leave no trace of your passage.  
### Favored Quarry  
<span class="move-trigger">When you declare a specific type of creature to be your Favored Quarry (goblins,</span> mages, ghosts, etc.), say how their kind wronged you and what you plan to do in return. Until you achieve it in full you cannot declare another Favored Quarry. Your Favored Quarry takes an extra condition from all of your attacks, can never surprise you, and is  
always treated as a dangerous monster to you.  
### Knowledge is Power  
<span class="move-trigger">When you Ponder or Examine a monster or wild creature,</span> on a **10+** gain 1 Prep.  
### Mastermind  
At the start of a Flashback, you may spend 1 additional Prep to gain Advantage on all rolls made during that flashback.  
### One Shot, One Kill  
<span class="move-trigger">When you ambush your foe with an attack,</span> if the GM thinks you can’t miss, then treat your first roll as a **12+** no matter the result. If you can  
miss, then treat a **6-** as a **7-9**, a **7-9** as a **10+**, or a **10+** as a 12.

### Scout Ahead  
<span class="move-trigger">When you go off on your own to explore a dangerous area,</span> roll **+DEX**.  
On a 7 or higher you make it back safely; the GM will describe what you encountered. On a **10+** choose two. On a **7-9** choose one. On a  
 **6-** choose one in addition to whatever the GM says.

<span class="move-trigger">When you search your belongings for a specific item you need right now,</span> if it’s relatively cheap (1 Wealth) and common, you have it. If it’s expensive or rare, you may spend 2 Prep to have it.  
### Trap Master  
<span class="move-trigger">When you set up a Trap Kit into a trap,</span> you and your allies can maneuver within and around it without any danger. Additionally, gain Advantage against any target while it is caught in a trap that you set.
