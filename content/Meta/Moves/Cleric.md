## Starting Moves   
You have all of these.  
### Atonement  
You have 2 Spirit. When you Settle In, reset your Spirit to this number.  
When you touch someone and pray for their well-being:  
If they are a PC erase as many conditions from them as you’d like and  
gain that many for yourself. If they are an NPC tell the GM what you’d  
like to heal (physical, mental, spiritual, etc.) and the GM will say how  
many conditions it will cost based on these guidelines:  
- 1 Condition - visible gash, furious temper  
- 2 Conditions - broken bone, night terrors  
- 3 Conditions - missing limb, tortured memories  
- 4 Conditions - mortal wound, violent madness  
- 5 Conditions - recent death  
You can spend Spirit like Armor to absorb conditions from Atonement.  
  
### Divine Agent  
You serve and worship a deity who grants you power. Give your deity  
a name, then define their domains by filling in each answer:  
- What they Control (eg. sun, seas, skies, animals)  
- What they Represent (eg. love, death, war, wind)  
- Who Worships them (eg. nobles, wizards, lovers)  
- Their Enemies (eg. undead, invaders, wolves)  
- Their Demands (eg. sacrifices, secrets, victory)  
<span class="move-trigger">While your deity Favors you,</span> their domains react obviously to your  
presence (eg. animals adore you, nobles bow, demons, etc.).  
<span class="move-trigger">When you ask your deity how to gain their Favor,</span> the GM will give  
you a task related to their Demands. When you finish it, mark 1 XP  
and gain your deity’s Favor.  
  
### Invocation  
<span class="move-trigger">When you call upon your deity’s power,</span> choose an Invocation you  
know and roll **+WIS**, with Advantage if your deity Favors you. On a **10+**  
your deity’s power flows through you and the effect comes to pass.  
On a  **7-9** the effect comes to pass but you must choose one.  
- The invocation’s Risk comes to pass.  
- You draw unwanted attention, probably from your deity’s enemies  
- You lose your deity’s Favor  
You start with 2 Invocations known (see Page 49).  
<span class="move-trigger">When you Level Up,</span> you can choose to Learn a New Invocation  
instead of another benefit. If you do, you also regain your deity’s Favor  
if you don’t already have it. While one Invocation is Ongoing, you can’t  
use another. You can end an Ongoing Invocation whenever you wish.  
  
## Advanced Moves  
You may choose one when you Level Up  
### Anathema  
<span class="move-trigger">When you harm your deity’s enemies,</span> inflict an extra condition.  
  
### Apotheosis  
Choose a feature associated with your deity (rending claws, sapphire  
wings, an all-seeing third eye, etc.). In recognition of your devotion  
and faith, your deity bestows this gift upon you.  
  
### Divine Intervention  
<span class="move-trigger">When you would Crumble while your deity Favors you,</span> your deity  
miraculously intervenes, saves you, and no longer Favors you.  
Afterwards you heal one condition.  
  
### Gifts of the Spirit  
Two Invocations that you know always have the Greater Effect.  
  
### Hype Man  
When you exceedingly praise a friend or ally before someone who  
Favors you (except your deity), they now Favor them as well.  
  
### Interfaith Studies  
When you encounter a faith or deity that you know about (your  
choice), you may ask the GM about three of their domains and they  
will tell you truthfully.  
  
### Inquisitor  
Whenever you’d like you may ask the GM ‘are enemies of my deity  
nearby?’ and they will answer you truthfully.  
<span class="move-trigger">Whenever you Examine or Scrutinize your deity’s enemies,</span> you gain  
 **+1** Insight even on a  **6-**.  
My Faith is My Shield  
Gain  **+1** Spirit. You can spend Spirit like Armor against any condition  
from your deity’s enemies.  
  
### Organizer  
<span class="move-trigger">When you and your allies cohesively Cooperate in a shared task,</span>  
instead of one person rolling with Advantage, you may lead a group  
effort. Everyone involved rolls individually and the highest result is  
used for everyone, but you must take a condition or spend 1 Spirit for  
every  **6-** rolled.  
  
### Peaceful  
No one who recognizes your faith will attack you directly and  
unprovoked, unless they are an enemy of your deity.  
  
### Shepherd  
<span class="move-trigger">When you publicly proclaim a warning,</span> judgement, or belief, those  
nearby notice and listen to your words; roll **+WIS**. On a  **10+** choose  
three. On a  **7-9** choose two.  
- Your words don’t attract unwanted attention.  
- You can ask your listeners one question as if you had Scrutinized  
them collectively.  
- Chooe a listener - they now Favor you.  
- Your listeners will achieve something collaboratively (build a  
bridge, burn a manor, acquire a treasure, etc.).  
  
### Spirit of Greatness  
Gain  **+1** Spirit. When you use an Invocation, you may spend 1 Spirit or  
use up your deity’s Favor to invoke its Greater effect.  
  
### Team Player  
<span class="move-trigger">When you Cooperate,</span> you can Push Yourself or spend 1 Spirit to grant  
an additional source of Advantage.  
  
### Thaumaturgy  
You no longer have to touch someone to use Atonement on them.  
When you petition your deity to perform a great miracle that pertains  
to their domains, tell the GM what you desire, they will give you a  
number of appropriate conditions based on the guidelines below,  
or say no. Like with Atonement, you can spend Spirit like Armor to  
absorb conditions gained from Thaumaturgy.  
1 Condition - Feed a large crowd  
2 Conditions - Calm a raging storm  
3 Conditions - Foresee an Ominous Force  
4 Conditions - Summon a divine envoy  
5 Conditions - Destroy or reshape a land  
  
### Theologian  
When you Ponder or Examine something related to your deity’s  
domains, you may ignore penalties from conditions and roll either  
 **+WIS** or  **+INT**.  
  
### Wrathful  
Gain  **+1** Spirit. When you inflict a condition, you may spend 1 Spirit to  
inflict an extra condition.  
Secret of the Divine (Requires Level  **10+**)  
You discover the greatest secret of your faith. Choose one way listed  
below that this secret can be used, or create a new one, then work  
with the GM to define what this secret is, how you learned it, and how  
it affects your faith.  
- You can destroy your deity’s enemies forever.  
- You can ascend to become a deity yourself.  
- You can fundamentally alter the world in a way related to your  
deity’s domains
