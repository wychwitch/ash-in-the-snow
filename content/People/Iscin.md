You can move and manipulate fire in a variety of ways - dimming, flaring, sparking, changing color, creating shapes and images, and more. Your fire is Distinctive, Fiery, and Near when you fight with it. Additionally, choose two traits for it:
- **Adaptable**: Your fire has the Intimate and Close tags.
- **Restrained**: You and nearby allies have +1 Armor against your fire and its effects. 
#### UNLEASH FLAMES
**When you fight using fire as a weapon**, roll +CHA. **On a 10+** you hurt your foe, but choose one. **On a 7-9** you hurt your foe, but choose two.
- You cause unintended collateral damage.
- You suffer a condition, perhaps due to overexertion or a foe’s counterattack.
- Choose and Burn one of your fire’s traits

#### CAPTIVATE
**When you share an intimate or enchanting moment with someone,** usually with time and privacy, roll +CHA. **On a 10+** you have 2 Charm over them. **On a 7-9** you have 1 Charm over them. They can reduce your Charm over them by 1 by:
- Giving you something they think you want.
- Doing something you tell them to do.
- Fighting to protect you.
- Favoring you, but only if they don’t already.
