A supposed prince from [[Ber-Vusamyr|Ber-Vusamyr]]. [[Axiom|Axiom]] and [[Moonie|Moonie]] are their companions. [[Noachi|Noachi]] is his babie
### Background
#### Seer
Whether it be due to birth, circumstance, or utter enigma, magic is as natural as breath to you.

Whenever you’d like, ask the GM “what here is magical?” and they will tell you truth.

### STARTING MOVES
#### EVOKE A SPELL
When you unleash your magical talents, choose a spell you know and roll+SPELL.
On a 10+ you successfully evoke the spell and its effects come to pass.
On a 7-9 the spell is still successful but choose one consequence from the list below.
- The spell’s Risk manifests as well.
- The spell’s magic drains you. You take -1 Ongoing to Evoke Spells until you next Settle In.
- Using it puts you in danger or draws unwanted attention, the GM will say how.
#### PRESTIDIGITATION
You can easily invoke minor magical effects without issue. Slowly moving small objects, creating minor obvious illusions, generating mild heat and sources of light, and other similar feats are all easily within your power without rolling.
#### THE SMOULDER
You always look good. Even if you’re wet, dirty, beat-up, or otherwise disheveled, you still look
great. When you use your impeccable good-looks and considerable charms to Compel someone, treat them as if they Favor you, but gain 1 Heat as you are burned into their memory. 
### Spells

#### Charm (Ongoing)
A creature you touch is bewitched into treating you as a trusted friend, and they Favor you for as long as the spell lasts. Once the spell ends, they know the effects of your magic.
**Risk**: The entranced creature, though your friend, still doesn’t Favor you deep down.
**Greater**: They don’t remember the effects of your magic when the spell ends.
-Though they treat you as a trusted friend, the creature’s behavior is otherwise unchanged. Someone paranoid might trust your honesty but not your accuracy, or a brutal warrior might still use violence to solve their problems. This spell lets you talk freely with those you might not otherwise be able to, but it usually doesn’t replace the act of talking itself.

#### Magic Missile (Ongoing)
You send bolts of magical energy at your enemies (Near, Distinctive, Piercing). While this is Ongoing, you can Let Fly by rolling +SPELL instead of +DEX.
**Risk**: The missiles aren’t Piercing.
**Greater**: Your missiles gain the ***Far*** and ***Forceful*** tags.
