All races can have half-races with Plainsfolks, though some are rare.  
  
Bestial Folk are races that are closer to creatures than they are to Humans, such as dragons, Ijsbeer, and Coeurl  
  
Dragonfolk refers to Dragonborn, Dragons, Half-dragons, kobolds. Confusing?? Yes

## Rare  
- Ijsbeer  
	- Straight up ripped from the bears in His Dark Materials  
	- Unlike most \*folk these have the bodies of full ass polar bears (but bigger) and the minds of humans  
	- Also while theyre a lil rare have them comingle outside their race more...   
	- Also YES they love their Armor just like in HDM fuck it, theyre fantastic smiths but culturally they usually only rlly like working with Adamantine, which is a very delicate metal until its processed properly, after which its Incredibly Strong  
	- Unlike most the more Bestial folks (Dragons or Coeurls) Ijsbeers not only have thumbs, but will wear clothing (though usually for decorative purposes, rather than to "hide their shame")  
- Coeurl  
	- Giant Sabertooth snow-tigers with huge whiskers  
	- Like dragons, are more bestial than folk, yet their intellegence is on par with humans.  
- Dragons  
	- Intelligent and frequently ancient  
	- Lesser dragons however are creatures, think of them to normal dragons as new world monkeys are to us  
- Kobold (Northern)  
	- Dog type! Doggos. In a variety of dog-breed shapes  
- Kobold (Southern)  
	- Dragon type!! Much smaller in stature than dragonborn.  
	- They both like packs and inexplicably can breathe fire (yes the dogs too). Sometimes the two kinds will quarrel but it's always lighthearted.
