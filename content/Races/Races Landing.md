All races can have half-races with Plainsfolks, though some are rare.

Bestial Folk are races that are closer to creatures than they are to Humans, such as dragons, Ijsbeer, and Coeurl.

Dragonfolk refers to Dragonborn, Dragons, Half-dragons, kobolds. Confusing?? Yes

## Common
- Plainsfolk
- Rabbitfolk
- Dwarves
	- Samurai blacksmith.
	- To avoid some common issues plague dwarves portrayal in media and also cos I just think it's cool: culture wise they focus more on the art of making cool shit with metal instead of hoarding GOld Like dragons
	- Tend to live in larger communities
- Elves
- Dragonborn

## Uncommon
- Goblins
	- V amphibious, long tongues and can jump big. Slick to sticky skin. Still have hair and teeth tho!!
	-  Goblins are (sorta)cold blooded which y'know kinda sucks in this world but they get around it by using Lots and Lots of cold-resistance potions, heat charms, and mostly just sticking together for warmth (literally and figuratively)
    - Sorta cold blooded meaning, they are still warm blooded it's just that they can't regulate their temperature As Well as other folk. They won't like, immediately die of exposure
    - They can be Sticky
    - As a direct result of their coldblooded nature they are very group oriented, you almost never see one goblin on their own for this fact. When they travel they do it in huge bands for safety in numbers and again to keep track of one another and make sure they're warm
    - Because of their culture of living a part of a huge group when they ARE alone they can struggle to make it, and will sometimes fall prey to joining guilds (good and bad ones) for that sense of belonging and support. Or sometimes they just scramble constantly. Lone Goblins have a bad reputation for petty thievery as a result of just trying to survive
    - Hobgoblins have axolotl-type horns and are usually more frail and coldblooded than normal. They WILL die of immediate exposure. As a result they're very rare and when you do see them they're usually so wrapped up in clothes you can only see the glint of their eyes and their horns sticking outta their layers of clothing. Their trade off is that they are usually extremely adept at magic and become religious leaders
    - It's not uncommon to see traveling bands of goblin merchants, since they tend to have a surplus of the supplies they make to keep themselves warm.
    - Kind of froggy.
- Halflings
- Tieflings
- Minotaur (Yak)
- Loxodon (Mammoth)
- Orcs
- Kobolds (Northern and Southern)
- Tabaxi
- Mouse and Ratfolk
- Kenku
- Tortle

## Rare
- Ijsbeer
	- Straight up ripped from the bears in His Dark Materials
	- Unlike most \*folk these have the bodies of full ass polar bears (but bigger) and the minds of humans
	- Also while theyre a lil rare have them comingle outside their race more... 
	- Also YES they love their Armor just like in HDM fuck it, theyre fantastic smiths but culturally they usually only rlly like working with Adamantine, which is a very delicate metal until its processed properly, after which its Incredibly Strong
	- Unlike most the more Bestial folks (Dragons or Coeurls) Ijsbeers not only have thumbs, but will wear clothing (though usually for decorative purposes, rather than to "hide their shame")
- Coeurl
	- Giant Sabertooth snow-tigers with huge whiskers
	- Like dragons, are more bestial than folk, yet their intellegence is on par with humans.
- Dragons
	- Intelligent and frequently ancient
	- Lesser dragons however are creatures, think of them to normal dragons as new world monkeys are to us
- Kobold (Northern)
	- Dog type! Doggos. In a variety of dog-breed shapes
- Kobold (Southern)
	- Dragon type!! Much smaller in stature than dragonborn.
	- They both like packs and inexplicably can breathe fire (yes the dogs too). Sometimes the two kinds will quarrel but it's always lighthearted.
