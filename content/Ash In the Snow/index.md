## Geography  
Havenloft is the colloquial name given to the large continent (and nearby islands) north of the equator of The World. This name can vary between societies and their people, but like Common (the still mostly ubiquitous language of the old, continent-spanning kingdom), people mostly recognize it as such. Other continents and countries exist, but due to massive glaciers only few crews are brave enough to travel to distant lands.   
  
The World has one sun and one moon, known as Vala, though the moon circles the earth much slower, lasting about four "months" of our time, or one entire season.   
- Sommerherald = spring   
- Sommersong = summer   
- Wynterherald = fall   
- Wynterwail = winter   
These seasons are further broken up by the phases of the moon, which will be detailed elsewhere  
  
## Climate  
The world is amidst an ice age, one that is only getting worse with time.  perpetually covered in snow and ice, just like most of the world has been for over a thousand years. Only countries around the equator is any reprieve from the cold, as small as it is.  
  
However, thanks to an ancient and magical items called Fallen Suns, many towns and cities are protected from the cold, the reach of the small sun's warmth creating a practically perpetual fall. Still chilly, but plants can grow and the townsfolk don't need to fear from snow outside of the deepest parts of winter.  
  
### Society  
Looking from above, region Havenloft is a shattered society. Whatever remnants of a once proud and uniting kingdom only survives through tales and snow-buried ruins. Instead, people gather around pockets of warmth provided by floating **Fallen Suns** and form their own societies. So cut off from each other, many have developed their own cultures and beliefs.   
  
Because of how difficult it is to navigate the world, it is not fully mapped out. Some people are trying to change that however.  
  
Despite how cut off people are from one another, there are still many roads that are kept as clear and maintained as possible to facilitate travel. Most travel during the summer month  
  
There are *many* theories as to where the winter came from, everything from an Ice Witch, a figured called The Great Lich, the sins of humanity, nature, etc. Some say the world has always been this way, and anyone who claim otherwise are strange folk.  
  
## Flora, Fauna, and Faethings  
- [[Ash In The Snow/Lore/Fallen Suns|Ash In The Snow/Lore/Fallen Suns]]  
    - Mysterious orbs of light and warmth. They look like small suns, floating above the towns that formed around them, providing a protective shield from the cold outside. Bizarrely, if you attempt to move them too far from their initial location, they will immediately go out.  
    - Every four years they need to be recharged by harvesting energy from one of many locations where multiple leylines converge. However, since the leylines constantly shift, the only way to find them is through scrying.  
        - Some places pay handsomely, some places do it on principal.  
- Common folk  
    - There are many folk, [[Races Landing|the full list can be found here]] , but the most common are Plainsfolk, Rabbitfolk, Dwarves, Elves, & Dragonborn.   
        - Also, *human* is a catch-all term for any "humanoid" race. So calling a Goblin a Human is correct. These are dungeon meshi rules!  
- Arctic Foxes  
    - Intelligent foxes that can perfectly mimic human voices. While smart, they are still animals and only really use their mimicry to fool humans in order to steal their food. Some folk keep them as pets.  
- Visonary Dragons  
    - Incredibly ancient dragons that are immune to the cold of Havenloft. They have no eyes. Not even a socket within which eyes once grew in some evolutionary ancestor. The top half of their faces, aside from their nostrils, is smooth and hard like a perfect wedge of marble.   
    - Like trees, they never stop growing as they age. Unlike trees, there has never been a record of them dying of old age.  
    - They are incredibly wise and regal, and most will even give advice to those who take the time to visit their domains.  Some even say that they dream of the future.  
- Regular Occuring Snowstorms  
    - There are 12 snowstorms that occur on regular schedules,   
        - 2 in spring  
        - 0 in summer  
        - 2 in fall  
        - 5 in winter  
            - The third winter one is always the worst  
- The Frozen Undead  
    - If a dead body is left buried under snow for a moon's cycle, they will rise again to become the frozen undead. No one knows why this may be, but because of this funeral rites have become complex and almost always involve the cremation of the dead.  
    - They can lay under the snow for years before rising.
