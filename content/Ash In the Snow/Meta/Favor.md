### What is Favor?  
Favor represents feelings of gratitude, honor, responsibility, or debt  
between a PC and another character (PC or NPC). A character who  
favors another will feel inclined to act in their interest, even if just to  
pay off a perceived debt.  
When you Favor someone, or someone Favors you, note down their  
name and the details behind the Favor. Two people can mutually Favor  
each other, and you can Favor as many different people as you’d like.  
While someone Favors you, they might treat you especially kindly,  
make you feel appreciated, act in your stead, or similar.  
- Gaining Favor: The most common way to gain someone’s Favor is  
by accomplishing a significant task for them, triggering the Gratify  
Move shown to the right. The significance of this task is judged by the  
character it’s done for, not the one doing it. One person might Favor  
you for the encouraging words you said when they needed to hear  
them, while another may demand you deal with a threat plagueing  
the area. GM’s should consider an NPC’s Want when judging if an  
accomplished task would gain their Favor.  
- Losing Favor: If you mistreat someone who Favors you, they no longer  
do so. Just like with gaining favor, what this entails is also up to the  
character who is Favoring you.  
- Favoring Others: You decide how you treat those you Favor, how you  
express it and what it means. Every character will have limits on how  
far they will go for someone they Favor.
